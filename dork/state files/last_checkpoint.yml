Rooms Descriptions:
  Bird Nest: You are inside a beautiful garden. The smell of nature makes you energized.
    There is a door to the north, and the trail to the east. There are 1000 ft walls
    on the south and west side of this garden.
  Dean Office: You are inside the Dean Office, a dangerous room for troublesome students
    like you. The east, west, and north sides of this room have doors, but the south
    end is a spiky wall.
  Entrance: Welcome the campus entrance! You are in the student success building.
    There are walls on the north and south ends of the room. There is a door in the
    east and a trail in the west.
  Hallway: You are inside a long hallway with a door on the east side of the room
    and a green door leading to the entrance on the west side. There are blank walls
    in the north and south ends of this room. The hallway is giving you chills, and
    you want to leave the room ASAP.
  Lounge: You are inside the lounge room of the campus. The air smells of poison.
    There are empty walls on the east and south side of the room. There is a hallway
    in the west and a door in the north.
  Trail: You are on a dirt trail. There are lots of pebbles and trees, and the sun
    is making you sweat. To the east is the entrance and to the west is the bird nest.
    You cannot go north or south because the trees are blocking the way.
  Treasure Room: You are inside a room painted with gold everything. Everything is
    enclosed in this room but its south end which has a door.
