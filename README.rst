Welcome to Dork! 

Dork is a text-based adventure game set in the year 2040 in MSU Denver.
It is a dark time for the university as a new Dean was initiated to the office.
The new Dean, while a good Dean, has been known for his hatred of birds.
This hatred is usually displayed through cruel acts like illegal hunting and capturing birds.
Recently, the dean has captured a Roadrunner and is planning to dispose of it 
regardless of the fact that the university's mascot is a Roadrunner. 

You play as a student of MSU Denver and upon discovering the Dean's evil plan,
you set out to free the Roadrunner from its cruel fate.
